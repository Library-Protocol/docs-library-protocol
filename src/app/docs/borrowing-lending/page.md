# Borrowing & Lending Books

The core functionality of Library Protocol revolves around the borrowing and lending of physical books, enhanced through blockchain technology. Here's how this essential process works.

## The Borrowing Process

### 1. Discovery

Readers can discover available books through:
- Searching by title, author, genre, or keyword
- Browsing library profiles and collections
- Receiving personalized recommendations
- Exploring curated lists and featured collections

### 2. Requesting

When a reader finds a book they want to borrow:
- They send a borrow request to the library owner
- The request includes proposed borrowing period and purpose
- The transaction is recorded on the blockchain as a pending request
- The library owner is notified of the request

### 3. Approval

Library owners manage lending through:
- Reviewing borrower profiles and reputation scores
- Checking the proposed borrowing terms
- Accepting, modifying, or declining requests
- Setting specific conditions if needed

### 4. Physical Exchange

After approval, the physical exchange occurs through:
- In-person pickup if geographically feasible
- Postal/courier shipping with tracking for distant exchanges
- Local community drop points in participating areas
- Integration with existing library infrastructure where possible

### 5. Onchain Recording

The blockchain records:
- The active borrowing period
- Verification when a book is received
- The return status and timeline
- Complete borrowing history for both parties

### 6. Return Process

Books are returned through:
- The same method used for the initial exchange
- Verification by the library owner upon receipt
- Closure of the blockchain record
- Updates to reputation scores for both parties
