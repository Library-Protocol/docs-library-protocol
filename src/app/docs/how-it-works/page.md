## How It Works

The raffle system is a core feature of SovereignYou, designed to incentivize users by linking NFT ownership directly to rewards.

**Mint to Earn Entries 🎟️**: When users mint content as NFTs, they automatically earn entries into the raffle. This system encourages both creators and consumers to actively participate and own content, enhancing their chances of winning.

**Raffle Frequency 📅**: Raffles occur at regular intervals (e.g., weekly or monthly), based on the prize pool size. Special raffles may also be held for high-value NFT creations or platform-wide events.

**Prize Pool Mechanics 💰**: The prize pool includes a mix of crypto tokens, NFTs, and sponsored prizes. These diverse rewards increase the value of participation and incentivize continuous engagement.
