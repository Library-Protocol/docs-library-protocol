# Manifesto

### KNOWLEDGE BELONGS TO EVERYONE

Books are the foundation of human progress. They contain the wisdom of generations, the power to inspire, and the tools to build a better future.
No one should be denied access to knowledgeâ€”not by geography, not by financial barriers, not by gatekeepers.

### LIBRARIES MUST BE BORDERLESS

A book sitting on a shelf, unread, is knowledge trapped in silence.
We bring libraries onchain, beyond borders, beyond limits. A global network where books move freely, where access is no longer dictated by location or privilege.

### OWNERSHIP AND ACCESS CAN COEXIST

Library owners should own their collections, not hoard knowledge.
Readers should access books, not beg for permission.
Blockchain makes this possibleâ€”ensuring trust, transparency, and fairness, without middlemen or centralized control.

### DECENTRALIZATION EMPOWERS COMMUNITIES

Libraries should not be controlled by corporations, governments, or gatekeepers.
Communities must own their knowledge.
We believe in a world where people, not institutions, build, share, and govern their own libraries.

### TECHNOLOGY SHOULD SERVE CULTURE

We use blockchain not for hype, but for purpose.
To preserve books.
To enable fair access.
To empower individuals.
To build an unstoppable, living knowledge network.

### THE FUTURE OF BOOKS IS OPEN AND COLLABORATIVE

This is not just a platform. This is a movement.
A movement for open knowledge, for shared wisdom, for a future where every book finds its reader and every reader finds their book.
