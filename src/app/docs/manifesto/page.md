# Manifesto

### KNOWLEDGE BELONGS TO EVERYONE

Books are the foundation of human progress. They contain the wisdom of generations, the power to inspire, and the tools to build a better future.
No one should be denied access to knowledgeâ€”not by geography, not by financial barriers, not by gatekeepers.

### LIBRARIES MUST BE BORDERLESS

A book sitting on a shelf, unread, is knowledge trapped in silence.
We bring libraries onchain, beyond borders, beyond limits. A global network where books move freely, where access is no longer dictated by location or privilege.

### OWNERSHIP AND ACCESS CAN COEXIST

Library owners should own their collections, not hoard knowledge.
Readers should access books, not beg for permission.
Blockchain makes this possible.

### DECENTRALIZATION EMPOWERS COMMUNITIES

Libraries should not only be left to the control of centralized gatekeepers.
Communities must own their knowledge.
We believe in a world where people and communities build, share, and govern their own knowledge networks.

### TECHNOLOGY SHOULD SERVE CULTURE

We use blockchain not for hype, but for purpose.
To preserve books.
To enable fair access.
To empower individuals.
To build an unstoppable, living knowledge network.

### THE FUTURE OF LIBRARIES IS OPEN AND CONNECTED

Knowledge should be free, borderless, and accessible to all. Library Protocol redefines what it means to own, share, and preserve knowledge by bringing libraries onchain. No walls, no restrictionsâ€”just a global, interconnected network of books, ideas, and learning.
