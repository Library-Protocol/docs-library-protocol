# Manifesto

### THE FREEDOM TO KNOW
Knowledge is the great equalizer, the force that has shaped civilizations, ignited revolutions, and elevated humanity beyond its limitations. It is not a privilege to be earned, nor just a commodity to be tradedâ€”it is the birthright of every mind that seeks to learn, question, and grow.

Books are more than ink on paper; they are the stored essence of human thought, the collective memory of our species, the unbroken thread that connects past, present, and future. They hold the dreams of visionaries, the wisdom of ancestors, and the blueprints for worlds yet to be imagined. To deny access to knowledge is to deny the potential of a mind, the progress of a people, and the future of a generation.

We believe in a world where knowledge flows freely, where books are bridges. A world where no one is too distant, too poor, or too powerless to learn. Because knowledge belongs to everyone. And when knowledge is free, so is humanity!

### LIBRARIES MUST BE BORDERLESS
A book unread is a voice unheard, a lesson unlearned, a possibility unrealized. Knowledge was never meant to be confinedâ€”neither by walls nor by borders, neither by institutions nor by privilege. Yet, for centuries, access to books has been shaped by geography, wealth, and power, turning knowledge into an asset of the few rather than the inheritance of all.

But knowledge, like light, like thought, like time, is meant to move.

A library is not a building; it is a bridgeâ€”between past and future, between cultures and ideas, between those who seek and those who preserve. We bring libraries onchain to dissolve the barriers that have kept books locked away. No more silent shelves, no more inaccessible archives. Just an open, living, global network where knowledge flows as freely as the minds that seek it.

### OWNERSHIP AND ACCESS CAN COEXIST
True ownership is not just about controlâ€”it is also about stewardship. A library is not just a collection of books; it is a gateway to ideas, histories, and futures. To own a book is to preserve knowledge, but to deny access, is to let that knowledge wither in isolation.

For too long, access to books has been dictated by permission, privilege, and artificial scarcity. Readers should not have to beg to learn, and owners should not have to choose between keeping their collections and sharing them with the world.

Blockchain changes this. It proves that ownership and access are not opposing forces but complementary ones. A book can belong to one and be available to many. A library can be owned and open at the same time. Through technology, we redefine what it means to share knowledgeâ€”not as something to be locked away, but as something to be lived, passed on, and continuously expanded.

Because knowledge is not just propertyâ€”it is a legacy. And a legacy is meant to be shared.

### DECENTRALIZATION EMPOWERS COMMUNITIES
A library should not be a walled fortressâ€”it should be a shared space, shaped and sustained by those who use it. Decentralizing knowledge is not just about removing gatekeepers; it is about returning knowledge to the hands of the communities that need it most. It is about ensuring that no single entity has the power to limit learning, erase history, or dictate what is worth preserving.

When communities own their knowledge, they own their future. They decide what is remembered, what is shared, and what is passed down. They create networks of wisdom that cannot be silenced, erased, or manipulated.

We believe in a world where knowledge is governed by the people. Where libraries are not just places, but living, breathing networksâ€”built, shared, and sustained by the very communities they serve.

### TECHNOLOGY SHOULD SERVE CULTURE
Technology fulfills its highest purpose when it is more than just hypeâ€”when it is seamlessly woven into the fabric of life itself. Knowledge is that fabric, the thread that connects generations, cultures, and progress. We use blockchain to preserve, to empower, and to make knowledge as fluid and enduring as life itself. A tool is only as meaningful as the culture it uplifts, and the future of knowledge depends on technology that serves, not damages, the essence of human connection.

### A NEW BOOK ECONOMY BECKONS
For too long, books have been seen as either possessions to be kept or expenses to be justified. But books are more than objectsâ€”they are living assets of knowledge, culture, and value.

We are building a new book economy, one where ownership does not mean isolation and access does not mean dependency. A system where readers can discover, borrow, and own books seamlessly, while book collectors, libraries, and individuals can monetize their collectionsâ€”not by locking them away, but by sharing them.

### THE FUTURE OF LIBRARIES IS OPEN AND CONNECTED
We redefine what it means to own, share, and preserve knowledge in an era where information should be as accessible as the air we breathe. Onchain, books no longer gather dust. They move, they inspire, they reach those who need them most. No gatekeepers. No artificial scarcity. No barriers between those who seek knowledge and the knowledge itself.

We envision a world where knowledge is not just stored but alive and truly accessible.
