## Prize Pool Mechanics

The prize pool in the SovereignYou raffle system is fueled by a variety of sources and offers diverse rewards to participants based on their minting and ownership of NFTs. The pool is designed to provide a rich and engaging experience for users:

**Token Rewards 💎**: The primary rewards are crypto tokens distributed to raffle winners. These tokens can be used on the platform, traded, or held as an investment.

**NFT-Based Prizes 🎨**: Users can win exclusive NFTs from the prize pool, including limited-edition content or collectibles minted by other creators. These NFTs add value and uniqueness to the user experience.

**Sponsored Prizes 🎁**: SovereignYou partners with brands and content creators who contribute additional rewards, such as sponsored NFTs, platform tokens, or unique experiences. These partnerships enhance the prize pool and create more opportunities for users to win.
