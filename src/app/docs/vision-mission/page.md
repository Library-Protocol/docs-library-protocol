# Vision & Mission

## Our Vision

Library Protocol envisions a world where knowledge flows freely between libraries and readers, transcending geographical, economic, and social barriers. We see a future where:

- Every library, no matter how small or remote, can reach readers globally
- Every reader has access to diverse books and knowledge sources beyond their local options
- Trust and transparency define the relationship between libraries and readers
- The joy of physical books coexists with the benefits of blockchain technology

## Our Mission

The mission of Library Protocol is to create an open, accessible, and decentralized ecosystem that connects libraries with readers worldwide through blockchain technology.

We are committed to:

- **Expanding Access**: Making books and knowledge accessible to more people by connecting libraries with readers globally
- **Empowering Libraries**: Giving library owners the tools to catalog, share, and manage their collections on-chain
- **Building Community**: Fostering a global community of libraries and readers that share and exchange knowledge
- **Enhancing Trust**: Creating transparent systems that build trust between all participants
- **Preserving Book Culture**: Supporting the continued relevance and vibrancy of physical books in the digital age

## Core Values

Our work is guided by these fundamental values:

- **Openness**: Creating systems that are accessible to everyone
- **Decentralization**: Distributing power and control among community members
- **Transparency**: Building trust through visible and verifiable processes
- **Community**: Valuing collective contribution and collaboration
- **Knowledge**: Believing in the transformative power of accessible information

We measure our success not just by technological achievements, but by how effectively we expand access to books and knowledge for people around the world.
